# Testing Phase: Strategy and Preparation

{{< figure src="cover" caption="alt" >}}

We are pleased to announce the official start of the **testing phase** for Project 42. This phase is crucial to validate all the essential functionalities, commands, and flows of our **Infinite Improbability Drive** blockchain before the official launch.

## Testing Strategy

### Two Official Networks

During this phase we will be working with **two official networks**:

#### Pre-Mainnet (Mainchain in Beta Phase)

- This is the "pre-mainnet" version of the main chain.
- Its existence is necessary to perform required technical tests.
- It will have a limited number of validators to keep it operational.
- It will be restarted from scratch when the beta testing phase ends.
- After the restart, the official mainnet will be launched.

#### Testnet (Test Chain)

- This will be the chain used during the initial testing phase.
- Anyone can set up a node and become a validator.
- It will be used to test, experiment, and ensure that any implementation works correctly.
- Validators who participate in this phase will be rewarded with real tokens on the mainnet.

## How to Participate?

Everyone has the option to support the project in two ways:

1. **Run a node** (both on testnet and mainnet)
2. **Become a validator**

### Participation Process

1. Configure and synchronize the nodes
2. Receive initial tokens [42] to create validators
3. Keep both chains running

## Characteristics of Testing Rounds

Cyclic Testing

A key feature is that **it won't be a single round of testing**, but rather we will conduct **cyclical rounds**:

- Weekly rounds and rounds every two weeks, depending on the round
- Every Thursday we will restart the chain to begin a new round
- This will allow us to collect metrics from each round, compare them, and analyze them

Accelerated Unlocking Period

- On the mainnet, the defined period for the gradual unlocking of tokens is **42 years**.
- During the testing rounds, this period will last only **1 week**.
- This will allow us to experience the unlocking and release process at an accelerated pace.
- We will be able to validate various behaviors of the economic system.

## Next Steps

In the coming days, we will publish:

- Instructions for installing **Drive**, the client that will manage the nodes in the chain
- Guides for starting the node on the testnet
- Detailed documentation of the configuration process

Each participant who sets up their node will receive tokens [42] to create their validator and begin validating.

Types of Tests

During this period, various tests will be carried out to validate:

- Different chain characteristics
- Essential commands
- Critical system flows
- General and group tests coordinated by the Lab
- Tests involving terminal commands
- Tests using specific tools or platforms

## Planned Activities

During the testing rounds, we will perform:

- Token movement
- DAO voting
- "Black Swan" scenario simulation
- And many other fun and unlikely activities

## Importance of this Phase

This testing phase is essential because:

- It allows us to validate all technical aspects before the official launch.
- We identify and correct potential problems.
- We ensure a flawless mainnet launch process.
- We create a documented history of each round for future analysis.
