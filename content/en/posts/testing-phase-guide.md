We are pleased to announce that we have entered a crucial phase of our development: **the testing phase** for the launch of **Project 42** and its main component, the **Infinite Improbability Drive** blockchain.

## About Project 42

**Project 42** is a complete digital cypherpunk nation, and **Infinite Improbability Drive** is its foundational blockchain. This blockchain represents years of research, development, and innovation, and we are now ready to begin the testing rounds that will bring us closer to its official launch.

> 🌐 Learn more about Project 42 on our main site: [infinitedrive.xyz](https://infinitedrive.xyz)

## What is the Testing Phase?

This phase is **crucial and essential** to validate all functionalities, commands, and critical flows of our blockchain before the official launch. During this period, we will carry out:

- **Exhaustive testing rounds**: We will evaluate the stability, security, and performance of the blockchain
- **Load testing**: We will verify the system's capacity under different conditions
- **Critical process validation**: We will practice and perfect procedures that will only be executed once on mainnet
- **Optimizations**: We will adjust and improve the system based on the results obtained

## Testing Objectives

Our main objective is to ensure that Infinite Improbability Drive is completely prepared for its public launch, meeting the highest standards of:

- **Security**: Data and transaction protection
- **Performance**: Efficiency and processing speed
- **Scalability**: Growth and adaptation capacity
- **Reliability**: System stability and availability

## Three Official Chains

During this testing phase, we will work with **three official chains**: **Mainnet** (as Pre-Mainnet during this phase), **Testnet**, and **Creative**.

It is important to understand that **during this pre-official launch testing phase, the three chains will function similarly** — all will be test chains and we will use them to perform **simultaneous and cyclical testing rounds**, thus optimizing our time and resources. The three chains will participate in the same testing rounds.

> 📖 **To learn in detail about the purpose and characteristics of each chain**, consult our complete guide: [Ecosystem Chains: Mainnet, Testnet and Creative](/en/posts/chains-ecosystem/)

## Testing Round Characteristics

### Cyclical Testing

A key characteristic is that **it will not be a single testing round**, but rather we will perform **cyclical rounds**:

- We will perform different testing rounds cyclically
- **The coordination of when we will perform the rounds and when we will restart the chains** will be done through our **Telegram channel in the testing subsection**
- This will allow us to collect metrics from each round, compare them, and analyze them
- Each round will bring us closer to a perfect and standardized launch process

> 📱 **Important**: While this blog contains the **instructions and complete flow** of what we will do, **real-time coordination** of testing rounds will be done through our **Telegram channel**. We recommend joining to stay up to date with announcements of new rounds and chain restarts.

### Accelerated Unlocking Period

- On mainnet, the period defined for gradual token unlocking is **42 years**
- During testing rounds, this period will last only **1 week**
- This will allow us to experience the unlocking and release process at an accelerated pace
- We will be able to validate various behaviors of the economic system in a compressed time

## How to Participate?

Everyone has the option to support the project in two ways:

1. **Maintain a validator node**
2. **Maintain an RPC node**

Each of these node types has essentially the same node functionality, but with different purposes:

- **Validator Node**: Responsible for validating transactions and keeping the network operational
- **RPC Node**: Responsible for providing or enabling services or endpoints for use by applications or users

**Tokens for Participants**

All those who participate in the chain and set up a node (whether validator or RPC) will receive [42] tokens. Each participant will have the free decision of what to do with them:

- Create their own validator
- Delegate them to other validators
- Use them for various tests (such as when we need to test transfers or transactions)

## Testing Process Phases

To guide you through this phase, we have structured the process into the following phases:

### Phase 1: Drive Preparation and Installation

Before starting the testing rounds, it is essential to properly prepare our environment. **Drive** is the client tool developed by the Lab that allows unified management of multiple nodes and services.

**In this phase you will learn:**
- What Drive is and why you need it
- How to install and configure Drive
- How to verify that Drive is correctly installed

> 📖 **Next step**: Consult our complete [Drive Installation](/en/posts/drive-installation/) guide

---

### Phase 2: Validator Preparation

Proper key management is **absolutely critical** for your validator's security. This information is essential and applicable in multiple contexts, not just during the testing phase.

**In this phase you will learn:**
- Importance of seed phrases and how to store them securely
- How to create and manage keys securely
- What `priv_validator_key` is and its critical purpose
- How to verify your `priv_validator_key` before creating a validator
- Best practices to avoid loss of access
- Complete validator preparation process

> 📖 **Consult**: [Validator Preparation](/en/posts/validator-preparation/)

### Phase 3: First Chain Launch

The first testing round focuses on the most critical process in a chain's lifecycle: **chain launch**.

**Why is it critical?**
- **It is only done once** in the chain's lifecycle
- It must be **very well defined and standardized**
- During the testing phase, we will practice it several times on our test chains
- **For Mainnet, it will only be done once**
- Therefore, we must practice and have the procedure very clear so that when we do it on Mainnet, everything works perfectly

**In this phase you will learn:**
- What chain launch is and its importance
- Prerequisites and necessary preparation
- Complete process description
- How to create your gentx (genesis transaction) step by step
- How to participate in the chain launch as a validator

> 📖 **Next step**: See [Launch Round 1](/en/posts/launch-round-1/) for the specific instructions for the first testing round

---

### Phase 4: Iterative Testing

After the first round, we will continue with cyclical rounds that will include:

- **Chain Launch restarts**: We will launch the chain again and again on the different chains we have (mainnet, testnet, and creative) at different times
- **Specific tests**: We will perform specific tests of different elements or components over time
- **Token movement**: Validation of transfers and economic operations
- **DAO voting**: Governance system testing
- **Scenario simulation**: Tests of different conditions and extreme cases
- **Functionality validation**: Tests of specific chain features

All these activities will be coordinated in real time through our **Telegram channel**. Each round will allow us to collect metrics, compare results, and perfect the system.

---

## Types of Tests

During this period, various tests will be performed to validate:

- Different chain characteristics
- Essential commands
- Critical system flows
- General and group tests coordinated by the Lab
- Tests that will involve terminal commands
- Tests that will use specific tools or platforms

## Importance of this Phase

This testing phase is essential because:

- It allows us to validate all technical aspects before the official launch
- We identify and correct possible problems in a controlled environment
- We ensure that the mainnet launch process is perfect
- We create a documented history of each round for future analysis
- We establish standardized procedures that will guarantee the success of the official launch

## Next Steps

We will keep the community informed about the progress of these tests through regular updates on this blog. We will share important milestones, relevant results, and any information we consider of interest.

**To begin your participation:**

1. Read and follow the [Drive Installation](/en/posts/drive-installation/) guide
2. Make sure you have completed [Validator Preparation](/en/posts/validator-preparation/), including secure key management and verification of your priv_validator_key
3. **The first round is here!** See [Launch Round 1](/en/posts/launch-round-1/) for the specific instructions for the first testing round
4. Join our Telegram channel for real-time coordination of rounds
