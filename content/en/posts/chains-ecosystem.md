{{< figure src="cover" caption="alt" >}}

The **Infinite Improbability Drive** ecosystem is composed of **three official chains**, each designed with a specific purpose. This guide will help you understand the differences, purposes, and characteristics of each one.

## Mainnet (Main Chain)

The **mainnet** is the main and official blockchain of Infinite Improbability Drive. This is the production chain where all real operations, economic transactions, and applications of the Project 42 ecosystem will be executed.

### Main Characteristics

- **Production chain**: Real tokens and transactions
- **Final configuration**: Definitive parameters and configurations for the complete ecosystem
- **Maximum security and stability**: Designed for critical and long-term operations
- **Token nomenclature**: `drop`
- **Address nomenclature**: Mainnet-specific

### Purpose

The mainnet is the heart of the Project 42 ecosystem. This is where:
- All ecosystem applications and services are executed
- Real economic transactions are performed
- Network governance is implemented
- The permanent and immutable record of all operations is maintained

---

## Testnet (Test Chain)

The **testnet** is a test chain designed as a **mirror in terms of configuration and parameters of the mainnet**. Its purpose is to allow developers to test functionalities and developments before launching them on mainnet.

### Main Characteristics

- **Mainnet mirror**: Configuration and parameters similar to mainnet
- **Test environment**: Ideal for application development and testing
- **Open access**: Anyone can set up a node and become a validator
- **Token nomenclature**: `tdrop`
- **Address nomenclature**: Testnet-specific

### Purpose

The testnet is designed for:
- **Application development**: Test new functionalities before implementing them on mainnet
- **Contract testing**: Validate smart contracts and decentralized applications
- **Experiments**: Test configurations and parameters without risk
- **Learning**: Understand ecosystem operation in a safe environment

---

## Creative (Free and Temporary Test Chain)

**Creative** is a test chain designed to be **completely free and temporary**. It functions as a testnet, but with specific characteristics for learning and rapid experimentation.

### Main Characteristics

- **Completely free**: Designed for anyone, student, or learner to use without barriers
- **Temporary**: Will automatically restart periodically (possibly weekly)
- **Quick tests**: Ideal for quick and temporary experimentation without long-term commitments
- **No barriers**: Does not require initial tokens or complex configurations
- **Token nomenclature**: `cdrop`
- **Address nomenclature**: Creative-specific

### Purpose

Creative is designed for:
- **Learning**: Students and learners can experiment at no cost
- **Quick tests**: Temporary experimentation without commitments
- **Prototyping**: Rapid development of ideas and concepts
- **Education**: Teaching and demonstration of the ecosystem

## Chain Comparison

| Characteristic | Mainnet | Testnet | Creative |
|---------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Production | Development | Learning |
| **Tokens** | `drop` | `tdrop` | `cdrop` |
| **Permanence** | Permanent | Permanent | Temporary (restarts) |
| **Cost** | Real production | Testing | Free |
| **Access** | Production | Open | Open |
| **Configuration** | Final | Mainnet mirror | Simplified |

## Which Chain Should I Use?

Chain choice depends on your purpose:

- **Mainnet**: If you want to participate in the main ecosystem with real operations and production
- **Testnet**: If you are a developer and want to test applications or functionalities before launching them on mainnet
- **Creative**: If you are a student, learner, or want to do quick tests without commitments
